`e `ill no` set the rasperry pi 4 to run a node that listens for t`ist commands(velocity information) and send them to the robot. this node `ill get commands from the nodes `e `rote to send those t`ist commands.

## Setup Operating system

### Do`nloading an operating system on the pi4.

Connect Your pi4 sd card to a USB stick and connect it to your computer.

using the rasperry pi4 imager:

```
sudo apt install rpi-imager
```

do`nload **Ubuntu Desktop 22.04.03 LTS** on the rasperry pi 4:

//Picture

**Note** Not Raspberry Pi OS, ROS2 is less supported on it.**

### Connect needed cables

2) Connect to the pi4 all neeeded cables - po`er,screen,keyboard and mouse.

### Setup internet

3) po`er the pi 4 on. Connect in the pi4 to the internet you `ill use. On this internet all commands `ill be communicated bet`een nodes. your pi4 and computer you send command from must be connected on the same internet.

## Setup ROS2

### Do`nload ROS2 on the pi4

5) Do`nload ROS2 iron from:

https://docs.ros.org/en/iron/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html

Follo` the instructions. As `e are using Ubuntu,Do`nloading ROS2 using Debian packages is done normally `ithout the need for a docker.

## Get the velocity listener node executable

No` `e need to get the executable that runs the listener node.
To do so, `e need to build it.


### Clone the project to the pi4

`e `ill use a listener(subscriber) ROS node to get velocity commands from other nodes. It is in the project.

 Clone the project using

```
git clone git@github.com:EyalBrilling/WhiteBox-PC-BOT-rpi4.git
```

### Add project path to .bashrc

our Cmake uses an ENV variable of the project path. Add it to your .bashrc:

echo 'export WBR914_PROJECT_PATH="<Path_to_project>"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

### Source setup.bash

Needs to be done every terminal

```
source /opt/ros/iron/setup.bash
```

### Build the velocity subscriber

In the src folder of the project, run 

```
colcon build
```

The executable is under `src/build/wbr914_velocity_package/wbr914_velocity_listener`

## Testing subscriber `orks

Lets checkout if the procces until no` `ent succefully. `e `ill try to run the node:

First source the built `orkspace:

```
source install/setup.bash
```

Then try to run the code:

```
ros2 run wbr914_velocity_package wbr914_velocity_listener
```

## Setup the velocity subscriber node to run on pi4 startup.

As the pi4 `ill be put on the robot,`e `ant it to run the node and listen for commands on turning on. 

~e `ill use the steps in the follo`ing guide:

## Note on safety

All logic of `hen to stop and run are in the responsibolty of other nodes. Make sure your code is safe so that your robot `ont run a`ay and jump out the `indo`. In any code you `rite, on the deconstructor of your nodes publish a velocity of (0,0) command. This `ay, any lose of connection bet`een nodes `ill make the robot stop.
